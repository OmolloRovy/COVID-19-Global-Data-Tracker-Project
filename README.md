# COVID-19 Data Analysis Report - Global and Nairobi Context

## Project Overview

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Our World in Data (OWID) dataset. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, visualization of key trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations), and a narrative of insights, with a specific consideration for the user's location in Nairobi, Kenya. While the core analysis in the provided notebook is based on historical data (up to April 12, 2023).

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Load and preprocess the OWID COVID-19 dataset.
* Visualize key trends in COVID-19 data, including total cases, total deaths, daily new cases, and vaccination rates for selected countries (Kenya, USA, India, Afghanistan).
* Illustrate the global distribution of total cases and vaccination coverage using interactive choropleth maps.
* Explore the availability of hospitalization and ICU data.
* Communicate key insights and observations from the data through a clear and readable narrative.


## Tools and Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **matplotlib:** For creating static plots.
* **seaborn:** For enhanced statistical visualizations.
* **plotly.express:** For generating interactive and geographical plots (choropleth maps).
* **IPython.display:** For rendering Markdown content within the Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3 and the libraries listed above installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```
2.  **Download the Dataset:** Obtain the OWID COVID-19 dataset in CSV format from the [Our World in Data website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases).
3.  **Update File Path:** Open the `COVID-19_Analysis_Report.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. In the first code cell, update the `file_path` variable to point to the actual location of your downloaded CSV file.
4.  **Run the Notebook:** Execute the cells sequentially. The output, including plots and print statements, will be displayed within the notebook. The final Markdown cell will present the key insights and narrative.
5.  **View Interactive Plots:** The choropleth maps generated by `plotly.express` are interactive. You can zoom, pan, and hover over countries to explore the data.

## Insights and Reflections (based on historical data)

Based on the analysis of the OWID COVID-19 data up to April 12, 2023, several insights can be drawn:

* **Global Impact:** The pandemic has had a significant global impact, with high cumulative case numbers observed across various regions.
* **Vaccination Disparities:** As of April 2023, there were notable differences in vaccination coverage across countries, likely influenced by factors like economic status and access to vaccines.
* **Evolving Trends:** The time series analysis of selected countries (including Kenya) reveals distinct waves of infections and varying trends in cases, deaths, and death rates.
* **Data Availability:** Hospitalization and ICU data, crucial for understanding the burden on healthcare systems, may not be consistently available across all countries in the dataset.
